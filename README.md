# py-d2

![Banner](docs/images/banner.png)

An unofficial, fully typed python interface for building [.d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) diagram files in python.

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-d2
```

## Usage

```python
from py_d2 import D2Diagram, D2Shape, D2Connection, D2Style

shapes = [
    D2Shape(name="shape_name1", style=D2Style(fill="red")),
    D2Shape(name="shape_name2", style=D2Style(fill="blue"))]
connections = [
    D2Connection(shape_1="shape_name1", shape_2="shape_name2")
]

diagram = D2Diagram(shapes=shapes, connections=connections)

with open("graph.d2", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(str(diagram))

```

produces the following graph.d2 file:

```d2

shape_name1: {
  style: {
    fill: red
  }
}
shape_name2: {
  style: {
    fill: blue
  }
}
shape_name1 -> shape_name2

```

This can be rendered using `d2 graph.d2 graph.svg && open graph.svg` or [https://play.d2lang.com/](https://play.d2lang.com/) to produce
